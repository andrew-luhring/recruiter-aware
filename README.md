# Recruiter Aware
### An application to make sure that people searching for clients are paying attention.

TLDR: This is an app that uses Selenium to log into your (Linkedin) account, 
scan all incoming messages for specific terms,
and replies to different responses with different messages.
Because I'm a web developer who is tired of getting linkedin messages that don't apply to me and I'm bored right now.
